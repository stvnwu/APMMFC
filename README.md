A Poor Man's MIDI Fighter Controller. 

Final Project for UC Berkeley's MUSIC 158: Musical Applications of Computers and Related Technologies. Written entirely in MAX.

#About

This is a 4x4 button sequencer that handles duration of button presses to increase the gain over a set period of time. There are three presets in genres of electronic music preset onto the board: electronic, chiptunes and EDM. 

#Keyboard Input

Loops are assigned to the red toggles and beats are in orange. The buttons are mapped to the left hand:

|  Use  | Your  | Left  | Hand  |
| :---: |:-----:| :----:|:-----:|
| **1**	| `2`   | `3`   | **4** |
| `Q`   | `W`   | `E`   | `R`   |
| `A`   | `S`   | `D`   | `F`   |
| **Z** | `X`   | `C`   | **V** |




#Mouse Input

The right hand is optimized for mouse interaction. Holding down the `SHIFT` key will allow the user to speed up or slow down audio playback by moving the mouse across the screen.
Holding down the `CTRL` key will pass the audio through a low-pass filter by moving the mouse up and down the screen.
